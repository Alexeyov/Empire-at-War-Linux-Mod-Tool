# Introduction
The EAW_LMT tool was created to automate a tedious process to pack mod files into .megs, in order to fix a particular stuttering present on linux. While there can be stuttering present in specific instances on mods, on linux the problem multiplies by showing up in other areas.

The reason for this stuttering is due to how mods organize their files. While the base game have everything packed into .megs, most mods have their audio, models and textures files loose. These folders can have thousands of files and be up 10 GBs in size, this in combination on how the game engine handles files, creates the extra stuttering. All of this create stress to the Proton layer, which have to keep up with the big number of file operations call for folders with an insane amount of files.

The answer to this is to pack the files back into several megs. However because doing so is quite tedious, I created this tool that automates the whole process, which should work on most Linux distros (if you are reading this you are probably covered unless you have some very weird and specific linux os).

What does the tool do?
 * It creates a new folder under corruption/mods/modname, making this a local mod is required to avoid steam workshop messing with it
 * It copies most mod files to the new location
 * The content of Audio, Textures* and Models gets moved to a TEMP folder where it is processed and packed into .megs
 * The megs then get moved to the mods location
 * After that you will launch the new mod by setting ```MODPATH=Mods/modname``` in the steam launcher settings of EAW
 * ```modname``` will be the same id number as it is shown in the workshop

(In the case of textures, some files that share the same name of base game files need to be loose, this however do not impact performance)

Also in the process of researching the reason of this stuttering and the tools creating I was able to find a fix to the game's font not loading properly. [EAW Game font](#eaw-game-font)

# Linux Concepts
Some concept clarification in order to follow the instructions easier. 

## Steam location
Usually in your personal folder ```home/username``` there is a hidden folder ./steam, your file explorer should have an option by just right clicking to show hidden files(otherwise just check the settings). From inside there should be a direct link to the steam contents where you will find ```steamapps``` and inside ```common``` where the game and most proton versions are located, and the ```workshop``` folder which leads to downloaded mods.

## Compatdata and Saves location
Inside ```steamapps``` there is the ```compatdata``` folder, this folder have a bunch of id folders, which have the same steamid as your games, 32470 being the id for EAW. These replicate the folder hierarchy of windows, and have files needed in order to run your games properly. 

EAW saves should be at ```32470/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Saved Games/Petroglyph/Empire At War - Forces of Corruption/Save ```

## Different Linux OS

You probably have downloaded Pop OS, Manjaro, Linux mint, Cachyos, or even SteamOS (maybe looking for making eaw mods run better on the steam deck). Most distros downloaded are forks or variations of a couple main OS, usually Debian, Arch, Fedora. 

This is important to know, because most instructions for installing some prerequisite will mention how to do it for these base OS (if you have a OS that is not a fork of any of these, you are welcome to open an issue, though searching the web for the equivalent way for your system will always be faster) 

This chart is not up to date, if your OS is not present here, check the main website/wiki of your system to see which system is based on, and what commands apply.

## Linux Distros

| DEBIAN                                                | ARCH                                 | FEDORA                               | 
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | 
| Ubuntu      |   SteamOS    | Bazzite |
| Kubuntu      | Manjaro | Nobara |
| Linux Mint   | Garuda  |  |
| PopOS     |CachyOS  |  |
| Elementary OS                |  |  |
| Drauger OS               |  |  |

## Installing from terminal
To Install new packages in general from terminal
| DEBIAN                                                | ARCH                                 | FEDORA                               | 
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | 
| sudo apt install     |   sudo pacman -S   | sudo dnf install |

Installing rsync for example on Linux Mint:
```sudo apt install rsync```

# Requirements
* An EAW mod already downloaded by the Steam Workshop (duh)
* Rsync
  * Rsync is a tool for copying/moving/transfer files with extra options and features
  * Check if you have it by open a terminal and type ``` rsync --version ```
* Wine
  * Wine is the original translation tool to run windows apps on Linux which Proton is based on
  * Check if you have it by open a terminal and type ``` wine --version ```
  * Proton from steam doesn't count, you need wine on its own (important to note that in order to play games on steam with Proton you don't need Wine, you just need Wine so a specific tool to pack the files in .megs can run) 

To install them, on a terminal anywhere:
| DEBIAN                                                | ARCH                                 | FEDORA                               | 
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | 
| sudo apt install rsync    |   sudo pacman -S rsync  | sudo dnf install rsync |
| sudo apt install wine    |   sudo pacman -S wine  | sudo dnf install wine |


* Wine Mono
  * If you ran winecfg at least once after installing wine, you should have it
  * Check if you have it by open an terminal from your username folder and type ``` ls ~/.wine/drive_c/windows/mono/ ```

After running winecfg, you should see this window

![winecfg](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17212ab3-0602-486e-ab50-08801a806a32)

You can close it once you see it

If after running winecfg, mono doesnÂ´t show, reinstall wine and run winecfg again.

# Using EAW_LMT
* Once downloaded, extract the content anywhere.
* Check the location of the EAW mod you want to process, EAW mods are located in ```/steamapps/workshop/content/32470```
* Copy or move the ```EAW_LMT``` folder next to the Data folder of the EAW mod (the folder, not the files)
* Inside the ```EAW_LMT``` folder you will see a ```EAWM_BUILD.sh``` file, either:
  * Open a terminal in that location (usually right clicking in the file explorer should show the option) and type: ```bash EAWM_build.sh```
  * Change the permission of the file to be allowed to be run as a programm and double click on it (select to run in a terminal if the option shows up)
* Wait and let it do it's thing.
* Either because it completes all operations or something went wrong, you will see the following ```Press Enter to close this window...```
* If everythign was fine, you now has a local mod and you will need to set your launch options with ```MODPATH=Mods/``` instead of ```STEAMMOD=```
# Troubleshooting
* Most problems will be related to some requirement that wasn't fullfiled
* For any problem a ```EAWM_log.txt``` file should show up in the same location, if the problem is not clear, feel free to open an issue on this git uploading the log.

# EAW Game font
There is an odd interacction where Proton returns the correct font back to the game, but does it by giving back the family-name value of the font, while the game is waiting for the type-name. 
A copy of a "tweaked" version of the font can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/cn94vw9mjuq0rt6s95z3z/EaW-Font-Proton.zip?rlkey=sxbg6dio45en9a2vox1dhwt3d&st=cn13oylc&dl=0)
In order to make the game load the new font, do the following:
* Extract the fonts
* Check what proton version you are using for EAW
* Go to the path directory of that proton version. Proton folders are located in the same steam folder as your games in ```steamapps/common```
  *  Unless you are using a custom one in which case is probably in ```compatibilitytools.d``` on the base Steam folder   
* Inside the proton folder, paste the fonts at ```files/share/fonts```
